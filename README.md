# Caesar Bot

This is a Facebook chat bot template project with minimal functionality.
It translates Roman numbers into Arabic ones. Oh - and it is talking
German only. This repository is meant to be a companion to an article
published in [t3n magazin](http://t3n.de/magazin/) (Nr. 45, 2016) but
you are free to use it you like.

## Prerequisites

You should know [git](https://git-scm.com/ "Git Homepage") and
[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Get nodejs") and have installed both.

## Setup

To create your own version of this bot just:

1. Clone or copy this repository

    ```bash
git clone https://github.com/smartsteuer/caesar-bot.git name-of-your-bot
    ```
    
2. Change to the new directory

    ```bash
cd name-of-your-bot
    ```
    
3. Install the dependencies

    ```bash
npm install
    ```
    
4. Test if everything works.

    ```bash
npm test
    ```
    
## Customize

At this point you are free to optimize, extend and change this bot as
you like. What ever you are intending to do in the future - the first
thing to do is to change the verify token Facebook is going to check
your webhook with.

1. Open `webhook-get.spec.js` and change the
   (token)[app/fb/webhook-get.spec.js#L14] to a freely selectable value.
   (You are going to share this value with Facebook later on)
2. Run `npm test` again
3. Fix all broken tests

You are good to go public!

## Deployment

Your bot is running locally - good. But we want the world to see it… (In
this example we are going to deploy on heroku but you are free to choose
any provider you like)

1. Be familiar with
   [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home "Heroku homepage") and install
   their toolbelt.
2. Login (if you haven't done this already)

    ```bash
heroku login
    ```
    
3. Create a new Heroku app

    ```bash
heroku create
    ```
    
4. Deploy (a.k.a. push to the heroku git) the app.

    ```bash
git push heroku master
    ```
    
More information on Node on Heroku can be found here:
[getting started](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs)

## Register your app with Facebook

I will not go into detail here, but with your app running on Heroku you
now have a URL which you can feed into the FB registration process for
new messenger apps. It's general structure is straightforward and looks
like this:

```
https://name-of-your-bot.herokuapp.com/fb
```

This is the webhook Facebook is going to communicate with.

## Configuration

For your app to work you need to set the access token which has been
generated by Facebook during the registration process.

1. Open the Heroku dashboard https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps
2. Find and open your app
3. Change to `Settings`
4. 'Reveal' your config vars
5. Add a new var with the key set to `FB_ACCESS_TOKEN` and the value to
   the token you got from Facebook.
